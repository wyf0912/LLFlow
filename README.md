### Quantitative results
#### Evaluation on LOL
The evauluation results on LOL are as follows
| Method | PSNR | SSIM | LPIPS |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| LIME | 16.76 | 0.56 | 0.35 |
| RetinexNet | 16.77 | 0.56 | 0.47 |
| DRBN | 20.13 | 0.83 | 0.16 | 
| Kind | 20.87 | 0.80 | 0.17 |
| KinD++ | 21.30 | 0.82 | 0.16 |
| **LLFlow (Ours)** | **25.19** | **0.93 (0.86)** | **0.11** |

(Our method measures SSIM value on grayscale images by strictly following SSIM's official code. We also assume that all LoL methods follow this [offical code](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/research/ssim/). Since some recent Python implementations of SSIM also provide the option for non-grayscale images, the results obtained using such unofficial implementations have been provided within brackets.)

#### Computational Cost
![Computational Cost](images/cost.png)

The computational cost and performance of models are in the above table. We evaluate the cost using one image with a size 400Ã—600. Ours(large) is the standard model reported in supplementary and Ours(small) is a model with reduced parameters. Both the training config files and pre-trained models are provided.

## Get Started
### Dependencies and Installation
- Python 3.8
- Pytorch 1.9

1. Clone Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/wyf0912/LLFlow.git
```
2. Create Conda Environment
```
conda create --name LLFlow python=3.8
conda activate LLFlow
```
3. Install Dependencies
```
cd LLFlow
pip install -r ./code/requirements.txt
```
### Dataset
You can refer to the following links to download the datasets
[LOL](https://daooshee.github.io/BMVC2018website/), and
[LOL-v2](https://github.com/flyywh/CVPR-2020-Semi-Low-Light). 
### Pretrained Model
We provide the pre-trained models with the following settings:
- A light weight model with promising performance trained on LOL [[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tukKu2KBZ_ohlQiLG4EKnrn1CAt_2F6G/view?usp=sharing)] with training config file `./confs/LOL_smallNet.yml`
- A standard-sized model trained on LOL [[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3kASTRXbnEnCZ0EcIvGhMHYkoJ8E2C4/view?usp=sharing)] with training config file `./confs/LOL-pc.yml`.
- A standard-sized model trained on LOL-v2 [[Google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7XwIlNr1lUxgZ9qlmFXCwzMTWSStQIW/view?usp=sharing)] with training config file `./confs/LOLv2-pc.yml`.

### Test
You can check the training log to obtain the performance of the model. You can also directly test the performance of the pre-trained model as follows

1. Modify the paths to dataset and pre-trained mode. You need to modify the following path in the config files in `./confs`
```python
#### Test Settings
dataroot_unpaired # needed for testing with unpaired data
dataroot_GT # needed for testing with paired data
dataroot_LR # needed for testing with paired data
model_path
```
2. Test the model

To test the model with paired data and obtain the evaluation results, e.g., PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. You need to specify the data path ```dataroot_LR```, ```dataroot_GT```, and model path ```model_path``` in the config file. Then run
```bash
python test.py --opt your_config_path
# You need to specify an appropriate config file since it stores the config of the model, e.g., the number of layers.
```

To test the model with unpaired data, you need to specify the unpaired data path ```dataroot_unpaired```, and model path ```model_path``` in the config file. Then run
```bash
python test_unpaired.py --opt your_config_path -n results_folder_name
# You need to specify an appropriate config file since it stores the config of the model, e.g., the number of layers.
```
You can check the output in `../results`.
### Train
All logging files in the training process, e.g., log message, checkpoints, and snapshots, will be saved to `./experiments`.

1. Modify the paths to dataset in the config yaml files. We provide the following training configs for both `LOL` and `LOL-v2` benchmarks. You can also create your own configs for your own dataset.
```bash
.\confs\LOL_smallNet.yml
.\confs\LOL-pc.yml
.\confs\LOLv2-pc.yml
```
You need to modify the following terms 
```python
datasets.train.root
datasets.val.root
gpu_ids: [0] # Our model can be trained using a single GPU with memory>20GB. You can also train the model using multiple GPUs by adding more GPU ids in it.
```
2. Train the network.
```bash
python train.py --opt your_config_path
```
